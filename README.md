# 🦠 COVID-19 Global Trends & Vaccination Analysis

A data-driven project that explores the spread of COVID-19 and global vaccination progress across selected countries using real-time data from [Our World in Data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data).

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- 🔍 **Load and clean** large-scale COVID-19 data from a trusted source.
- 📊 **Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on total cases, deaths, death rates, and new daily cases.
- 💉 **Visualize vaccination progress** across countries.
- 📈 Generate insights on **infection trends**, **case fatality rates**, and **vaccination rollouts**.

💡 Key Insights & Reflections
📈 S-shaped trends observed in total cases and deaths, indicative of pandemic waves.

⚰️ Death rate trends varied widely—higher at the beginning, stabilizing with time and treatment.

💉 Vaccination rollout patterns differed significantly, with early adoption in developed countries.

⚠️ Data variability due to differences in testing policies, healthcare infrastructure, and reporting accuracy across countries.

This project demonstrates how timely data and visualization can guide public health insights and policies.
